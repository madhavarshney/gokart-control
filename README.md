# Go-Kart Control

This is a project to build a self-driving go-kart vehicle hosted by the Engineering Club @ Foothill College. Currently, the vehicle can be remote-controlled via a webpage or a physical RC remote. A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is used to host the web interface and an Arduino Uno is used to manage the control and sensor systems.
